            <h2>
                And love breaks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my photography world! I am a passionate photographer based in the beautiful city of
                Aix-en-Provence, France.
                While I find immense joy in capturing various subjects, my true passion lies in the art of automotive
                photography.
                There is something magical about combining my love for cars and photography, as I strive to capture the
                sleek lines,
                vibrant colors, and raw energy of these magnificent machines. However, I am not limited to just one
                genre.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy exploring diverse subjects and capturing the essence of each moment. From landscapes to
                portraits, architecture
                to street photography, I find inspiration in the multitude of places that France has to offer.
                Through my lens, I aim to immortalize the beauty that surrounds us and share my unique perspective with
                the world.
                Join me on this visual journey and let's create timeless memories together.
